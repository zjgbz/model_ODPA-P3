# model_ODPA-P3

The softwares and packages needed for the codes are:
1. LAMMPS (Mar 2018) (parallel version)
2. Python 3.7.0:<br />
(1) Numpy<br />
(2) Jupyter Lab<br />
(3) Pandas<br />
(4) Scipy<br />
(5) Matplotlib<br />

Codes here are used to model the amorphous ODPA-P3, and perform the tensile test to the polymer.

The main code is polymer_standard.txt. The input file is the configuration file of the polymer chains uniform_polymer.dat, and the output files are a lammpstrj which can be used to visulize the simulation, and a .txt file which include the stress and strain value during the deformation. The stress-strain data file will be used to calculate the Young's Modulus of the model.

The main code polymer_standard.txt is based on LAMMPS, and the following command is used to execute the code:

$ mpirun -n 4 lmp_mpi -in polymer_standard.txt

The configuration file of the polymer chains uniform_polymer.dat is generated by the python file create_uniform_polymer.py. Running the following command will generate the corresponding configuration file.

$ python3 create_uniform_polymer.py > uniform_polymer.dat 2>&1

To process the stress-strain data, you should first login the jupyter lab, then open the process_strain_stress.ipynb. By replacing the filename (the first line in the second code block), you can execute the code step by step to get the stress-strain curve and the Young's Modulus.
